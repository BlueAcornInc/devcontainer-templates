# Commerce Devcontainer

This devcontainer runs Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source for development and testing purposes.

## Requirements

### auth.json or $COMPOSER_AUTH

Commerce requires access to the repos.magento.com repository, so a valid composer auth must be provided.

## Codespaces

This template will run in a Github Codespace, but is still being developed and has some limitations at this point.
